Here are some tips to keep the session running smoothly.

## Kata Choice

Some sessions lend themselves towards particular katas. Although it is nice to tackle different puzzles, keep in mind that by keeping the kata static, the participants can focus on practicing the particular theme of the session. 

As such, with a consistent group, try to repeat the same problem a number of times, so they become comfortable with the domain, and focus on improving their process.

## Programming Language

The common denominator is usually javascript, but if people want to use something else, they must make sure the rest of their group they are pairing/mobbing with are comfortable with the language.

## Timings

These sessions were run for the first time over two hours, but could be adapted/combined for different session lengths.

The two hour session was split up into the following:

* Introduction from the session's readme
* Coding (~40 minutes)
* Observations to the group (5-10 minutes)
* Break (5-10 minutes)
* Re-iterate goal of the session, or introduce a more advanced concept to keep in mind
* Coding (~40 minutes) - make sure to switch up the pairs, and delete previous progress
* Micro-retro (~10 minutes)

## Coding

Make sure they are adhering to the constraints for each session, its too easy for people to get engrossed in the puzzle, and revert to their standard operations. The pairing constraints are there to make sure everyone is being heard and contributing.

### Observations/Guidance

Each session should have some key items to focus on, so when you drop into each breakout group, try and steer them towards those, as well as focussing on the core ideas:

* take baby steps
* keep the tests green where possible
* don't spend too long with failing tests, and revert breaking changes and refactor when you do

### Micro-Retro

Some options to prompt the conversation:

* Have each group talk through their code, describing what went well
* What went well/struggled with
* Ask each attendee what there key take-away from the session is/what they'll try next time
* Group code review (!)
