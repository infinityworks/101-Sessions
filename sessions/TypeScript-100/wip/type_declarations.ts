/*
    Type Declarations

    So we've seen how adding types to our code can help make things better, but
    what about libraries?
    
    Having types for the parts of your application that arenâ€™t your code will
    greatly improve your TypeScript experience. 
    Where do these types come from?

let x = Math.max(1, 20, 8, 70);

let y = Math.abs(1, 20, 8, 70);     // error: Expected 1 arg but got 4

/*
    How did typescript know?

    Ctrl+Click into the definition of Math.abs and you can see the types
    which have been added as declarations for the standard Math
    implementation:

        abs(x: number): number;

    Most modules will export a `.d.ts` type declaration file which makes
    working with that library in typescript much easier.
